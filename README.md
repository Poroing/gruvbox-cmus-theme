# gruvbox-cmus-theme
Yet another cmus gruvbox colorscheme for cmus.

## Why?

This theme has been created because the official reposiory's gruvbox-themes
didn't fit well with the overall look of my desktop.

## Instalation

Put the theme in your cmus directory:
	$ cp gruvbox.theme $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/
And tell cmus about your new colorscheme by adding
	colorscheme gruvbox
to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/rc` which is usualy `~/.config/cmus/rc`.
